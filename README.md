# IndiaTravelPatterns

This project is based on the paper "Quantifying geography- and gender-based inequity in travel behavior of the Indian population" by Bismark Singh that is currently under peer-review. This repository will be continuously updated. Here, we provide the underlying raw and cleaned datasets that are taken from India's 2011 Census. Spreadsheets for the results presented in the article will also be uploaded here.
